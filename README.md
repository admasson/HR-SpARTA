# HR-SpARTA

COMING SOON: HR-SpARTA, for "High Resolution Spectral Analysis of Remote Transiting exoplanet Atmosphere", is a repository that will host the public codes developed during my PhD for reducing and processing high-resolution spectroscopic data for exoplanetary atmosphere characterization (currently ongoing test phase on data from the SPIRou instrument).
