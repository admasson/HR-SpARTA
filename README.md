# HR-SpARTA

COMING SOON: HR-SpARTA, for "High Resolution Spectral Analysis of Remote Transiting exoplanet Atmosphere", is a repository that will host the public codes developed during my PhD for:
- reduce and process high-resolution spectroscopic data for exoplanetary atmosphere characterization (tested on data from the SPIRou instrument, will be tested with other instruments like CARMENES)
- measure atmospheric escape through the metastable helium triplet line using our custom parker-wind 1D NLTE radiative transfer code (compatible with p-winds hydrodynamical module)
- analyze high-resolution spectroscopic data for molecular detection using the CCF method

These tools are undergoing their final test phase and will progressively be published here along with their associated publications.
